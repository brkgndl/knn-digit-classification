# Digit Recognizer with scikit-learn - First experience

This project is a very simple KNN classifier that recognizes handwritten digits using the scikit-learn library.
Also, this is my first experience working with KNN algorithm. This project helped me understand the KNN better and gave me motivation to learn more about machine learning.Thank you.

## Features

- Uses the digits dataset  
- Tests different values of k and shows accuracy  
- Shows images with predicted numbers  
- Prints wrongly predicted examples  

## Setup

To install the needed libraries, run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
